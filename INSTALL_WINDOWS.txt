Goon Squad Bots - Windows Installation Guide
===========================================

This guide walks through installing and launching the bots on Windows using a
terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell or Git Bash). Each step notes which
folders you will modify. Linux and macOS users should refer to `INSTALL.txt`.

1. **Install Python**
   - Download and install Python 3.8 or newer from <https://www.python.org>. Make
     sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2. **Clone or download the repository**
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```cmd
     git clone <repo-url>
     cd grimmbot
     ```
     Replace `<repo-url>` with the URL of this repository. All other steps assume
     you are inside this `grimmbot` folder.

3. **Install Python packages** (requirements folder)
   - Run:
     ```cmd
     py -3 -m pip install -r requirements\base.txt
     ```
     This installs `discord.py`, `python-dotenv`, and the other required
     libraries. The `requirements` directory also contains `extra-dev.txt` for
     development tools (optional).

4. **Create the configuration file** (config folder)
   - Copy the provided template:
     ```cmd
     copy config\env_template.env config\setup.env
     ```
   - Open `config\setup.env` in a text editor and fill in your Discord tokens and
     any API keys. These values are used by all bots. Do not commit this file to
     version control.

5. **Optional: Add local media** (localtracks folder)
   - Place any music or sound files you want the bots to play into the
     `localtracks` directory. The `media_player.py` helper can load files from
     here when responding to music commands.

6. **Running the bots**
   - From the repository root, start a bot with one of the following commands:
     ```cmd
     py -3 grimm_bot.py   # uses ! commands
     py -3 bloom_bot.py   # uses * commands
     py -3 curse_bot.py   # uses ! commands
     py -3 goon_bot.py    # unified bot loading all cogs
     ```
   - Each bot reads from `config\setup.env` and loads extensions from the `cogs`
     directory.

7. **Customizing cogs** (cogs folder)
   - The `cogs` folder contains modules such as `grimm_cog.py`, `bloom_cog.py`,
     and `music_cog.py`. Modify or add files here to extend the bots. Reload a
     cog at runtime using the Admin commands if you run `goon_bot.py`.

That's it! After completing these steps you can run any of the bots directly
from your Windows terminal. Make sure `config\setup.env` is populated with the
required tokens before launching.
Each cog defines a COG_VERSION constant so you can see when modules change.
