Goon Squad Bots - Windows Installation Guide
===========================================

This guide walks through installing and launching the bots on Windows using a
terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell or Git Bash). Each step notes which
folders you will modify. Linux and macOS users should refer to `INSTALL.txt`.

1. **Install Python**
   - Download and install Python 3.8 or newer from <https://www.python.org>. Make
     sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2. **Clone or download the repository**
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```cmd
     git clone <repo-url>
     cd grimmbot
     ```
     Replace `<repo-url>` with the URL of this repository. All other steps assume
     you are inside this `grimmbot` folder.

3. **Run the interactive installer**
   - The easiest way to set everything up is:
     ```cmd
     py -3 install.py
     ```
     This installs dependencies and walks you through creating
     `config\setup.env`.

4. **Manual setup** (optional)
   - If you prefer to do things yourself:
     ```cmd
     py -3 -m pip install -r requirements\base.txt
     copy config\env_template.env config\setup.env
     ```
   - Edit `config\setup.env` in a text editor and fill in your Discord tokens
     and any API keys. Do not commit this file to version control.

5. **Optional: Add local media** (localtracks folder)
   - Place any music or sound files you want the bots to play into the
     `localtracks` directory. The `media_player.py` helper can load files from
     here when responding to music commands.

6. **Running the bots**
   - From the repository root, start a bot with one of the following commands:
     ```cmd
     py -3 grimm_bot.py   # uses ! commands
     py -3 bloom_bot.py   # uses * commands
     py -3 curse_bot.py   # uses ! commands
     py -3 goon_bot.py    # unified bot loading all cogs
     ```
   - Each bot reads from `config\setup.env` and loads extensions from the `cogs`
     directory.

7. **Customizing cogs** (cogs folder)
   - The `cogs` folder contains modules such as `grimm_cog.py`, `bloom_cog.py`,
     and `music_cog.py`. Modify or add files here to extend the bots. Reload a
     cog at runtime using the Admin commands if you run `goon_bot.py`.

That's it! After completing these steps you can run any of the bots directly
from your Windows terminal. Make sure `config\setup.env` is populated with the
required tokens before launching.
Each cog defines a COG_VERSION constant so you can see when modules change.
