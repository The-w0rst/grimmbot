# GrimmBot

This repository contains three simple Python bots located in the `bots/` directory:

1. **Bot1** – an echo bot that repeats whatever you tell it.
2. **Bot2** – a bot that returns the current time.
3. **Bot3** – a bot that tells a random joke.

Run them all using:

```bash
python main.py
```

Run tests using:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
