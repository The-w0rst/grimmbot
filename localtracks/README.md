# Local Tracks

This folder holds optional audio and lyric files used by BloomBot and the music player.

- Put MP3/FLAC/OGG files directly in this folder or any subfolder to play them with the `*play` command.
This folder can also hold plain text lyric files. Place one song per file with the same name as the track and a `.txt` extension. BloomBot will read the lines when you trigger the `*sing` commands.
