Full Speed Ahead

[Odysseus:]
We’ve set our course, the wind is strong
The sea is wild, but we belong
Out on these waves, we chase the dawn
With every hope, we carry on

[Crew:]
Full speed ahead, no looking back
With every mile, we blaze our track
The gods may laugh, the fates may sneer
But we will never show our fear

[Odysseus:]
The map is gone, the stars are blurred
The stories told, the songs unheard
But still we sail, we brave the night
For home and love, we’ll win this fight

[Crew:]
Full speed ahead, no looking back
With every mile, we blaze our track
The gods may laugh, the fates may sneer
But we will never show our fear

[Bridge:]
We ride the storm, we curse the sky
We hold our hope, we will not die

[Odysseus and Crew:]
Full speed ahead, no looking back
With every mile, we blaze our track
The gods may laugh, the fates may sneer
But we will never show our fear
Full speed ahead!
