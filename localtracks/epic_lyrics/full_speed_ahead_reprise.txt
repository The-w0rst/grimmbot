Full Speed Ahead (Reprise)

[Odysseus:]
Once again we take the helm
A thousand miles from home and realm
But hope is burning in our eyes
With every wave, our spirits rise

[Crew:]
Full speed ahead, we brave the storm
No turning back, our courage sworn
The gods may test, the fates may play
But we will see the light of day

[Odysseus:]
Though weary bones and battered sails
We ride the winds, we will not fail
With every heart, we find our way
We live to fight another day

[Crew:]
Full speed ahead, we brave the storm
No turning back, our courage sworn
The gods may test, the fates may play
But we will see the light of day

[All:]
Full speed ahead!
