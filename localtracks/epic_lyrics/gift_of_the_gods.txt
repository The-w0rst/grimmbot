Gift of the Gods

[Odysseus:]
Deceitâ€™s a weapon, sharp and sly
The walls too high, the stakes too high
So let them think the war is done
The gift of peace, a ruse begun

[Crew:]
Gift of the gods, the city sleeps
While in the dark, the secret creeps
The horse will stand, the guards will yawn
But in the night, we carry on

[Athena:]
Sometimes the mind must win the day
A clever ploy, a daring play
Let foolish pride bring on their fall
For wit and guile will conquer all

[Odysseus:]
They take the bait, they praise the gods
But do not see the trick is flawed
The hour comes, the time is near
The fall of Troy is drawing near

[All:]
Gift of the gods, the city sleeps
While in the dark, the secret creeps
The horse will stand, the guards will yawn
But in the night, we carry on

[Bridge:]
Let history tell of how we won
By gift of gods and will undone

[All:]
Gift of the gods, the city sleeps
While in the dark, the secret creeps
The horse will stand, the guards will yawn
But in the night, we carry on
