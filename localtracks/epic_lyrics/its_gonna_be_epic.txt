It's Gonna Be Epic

[Odysseus:]
I will not let this fail, I will not let us fall
There’s a path that we’re supposed to take and I will see it all
The world outside is waiting and it’s calling out our names
We’ll write a story they will tell and never be the same

[All:]
It’s gonna be epic, this journey we’re on
It’s gonna be epic, together we’ll be strong
We’ll find a way, and we’ll make it through
It’s gonna be epic, me and you

[Odysseus:]
We’ve sailed across the oceans, we’ve been battered by the waves
But every scar’s a lesson and a mark of the brave
When hope is all that’s left to lose and fate is in our hands
We’ll fight until the final breath and take our final stand

[All:]
It’s gonna be epic, this journey we’re on
It’s gonna be epic, together we’ll be strong
We’ll find a way, and we’ll make it through
It’s gonna be epic, me and you

[Bridge:]
Even if the gods decide to send us astray
We will find a way, we will not be afraid
Standing together, nothing can break us down
With hope in our hearts, we’ll turn this ship around

[All:]
It’s gonna be epic, this journey we’re on
It’s gonna be epic, together we’ll be strong
We’ll find a way, and we’ll make it through
It’s gonna be epic, me and you
