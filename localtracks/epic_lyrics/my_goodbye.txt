My Goodbye

[Penelope:]
How do I hold on to hope
When every day you’re further away
I watch the tides rise and fall
Counting the nights, praying you’ll stay

[Odysseus:]
The road is long, the gods are cruel
But every scar is proof I survived
I hear your voice inside the storm
A promise that keeps me alive

[Both:]
If I could fly, I’d cross the sea
Break every chain, return to thee
But fate’s design we can’t defy
So here’s my love, here’s my goodbye

[Penelope:]
Every letter left unsent
Every word that’s left unheard
Still my heart is yours to keep
Beyond the edge of every word

[Odysseus:]
If you ever lose your way
Look for me in wind and sky
I’ll be the hope that brings you light
When you’re alone, remember I

[Both:]
If I could fly, I’d cross the sea
Break every chain, return to thee
But fate’s design we can’t defy
So here’s my love, here’s my goodbye

[Bridge:]
Until the stars forget to shine
You’ll have my heart, forever mine

[Both:]
If I could fly, I’d cross the sea
Break every chain, return to thee
But fate’s design we can’t defy
So here’s my love, here’s my goodbye
