[Penelope:]
I wait for you through endless days and nights
With hope that sails upon these distant tides
The world is changing, but my heart remains
Open arms for you, through joy and pain
I count the stars and trace them to your name
The fire flickers, but the love’s the same
The winds may carry you across the sea
But every breath you take comes back to me
With open arms, I’ll welcome you
No matter what you’ve seen or what you’ve been through
With open arms, I’ll wait for you
I’ll be your shelter, your anchor, your truth
I see your face in every passing dream
A thousand miles apart, or so it seems
But love will be the path that brings you home
I’ll never let you walk this world alone
With open arms, I’ll welcome you
No matter what you’ve seen or what you’ve been through
With open arms, I’ll wait for you
I’ll be your shelter, your anchor, your truth
[Bridge:]
If the gods are cruel, and the fates unkind
I’ll fight for you till the end of time
With open arms, I’ll welcome you
No matter what you’ve seen or what you’ve been through
With open arms, I’ll wait for you
I’ll be your shelter, your anchor, your truth
