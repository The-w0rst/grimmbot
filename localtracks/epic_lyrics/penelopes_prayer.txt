Penelope's Prayer

[Penelope:]
O gods above, hear my plea
Guide him home, bring him back to me
Across the sea, through storm and strife
Let him return to our life

Let every star burn through the night
Let every wave turn wrong to right
Let hope be strong, let sorrow bend
And let this waiting come to end

If fate is cruel, if time betrays
Still I will wait through endless days
For in my heart, in dreams I find
His memory is intertwined

O gods above, hear my prayer
Send him home, let him know I care
Through every dawn, through every fight
Bring him home, back to my light
