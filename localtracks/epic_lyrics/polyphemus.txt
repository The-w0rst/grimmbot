Polyphemus

[Polyphemus:]
Who dares disturb my cave at night?
I smell the blood, I hear the fright
You think you’re clever, sneaking by
But in my land, the weak will die

I am the giant, the tale of dread
With single eye and appetite to be fed
You’ll beg for mercy, you’ll wish to flee
But now you’re trapped, alone with me

[Odysseus:]
The gods above, they test my will
With monsters set to hunt and kill
But I will not be cowed or break
I’ll find a way, my men I’ll save

[Polyphemus:]
You thought your lies would see you through
But now my rage will fall on you!
I’ll crush your bones, I’ll feast tonight
You’ll curse the day you crossed my sight

[All:]
Monsters come in every form
A test of wit, a trial born
We’ll trick the brute, we’ll find the sun
The journey home has just begun
