Remember Them

[Odysseus:]
Raise a glass for those who fell
For every tale we have to tell
For every brother lost at sea
We carry on their memory

[Crew:]
Remember them, the brave and bold
The stories of their deeds retold
Their courage echoes on the wind
Their fire will not be dimmed

[Odysseus:]
I see their faces in my mind
The friends and souls we left behind
I swear by all the gods above
Their names endure, their lives we love

[Crew:]
Remember them, the brave and bold
The stories of their deeds retold
Their courage echoes on the wind
Their fire will not be dimmed

[Bridge:]
Though fate may steal their final breath
Our hearts refuse to yield to death

[All:]
Remember them, the brave and bold
The stories of their deeds retold
Their courage echoes on the wind
Their fire will not be dimmed
