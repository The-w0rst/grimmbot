[Telemachus:]
They say I am my father’s son
A name that weighs a thousand tons
A hero lost across the tide
A story told but hard to find

I stare into the restless waves
I wonder if he’s met his grave
Or if he fights on foreign sands
Still dreaming of these distant lands

I am the son of the sea
Caught in the pull of the waves beneath me
Trying to find who I’m meant to be
I am the son of the sea

[Penelope:]
My child, your father’s journey’s long
But in your heart, you must be strong
For every tear the world has cried
There’s hope that’s carried by the tide

[Telemachus:]
I am the son of the sea
Caught in the pull of the waves beneath me
Trying to find who I’m meant to be
I am the son of the sea

[Bridge:]
And when the night grows cold and deep
I’ll hold his memory as I sleep

[All:]
I am the son of the sea
Caught in the pull of the waves beneath me
Trying to find who I’m meant to be
I am the son of the sea
