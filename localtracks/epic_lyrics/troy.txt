Troy

[Odysseus:]
The walls rise high, the gates are strong
A city holding out so long
The gods have watched, the fates have spun
But now the final war’s begun

[Crew:]
Troy, oh Troy, the legend’s born
A kingdom proud, a people sworn
For every tear, for every scar
The end is near, we’ve come this far

[Athena:]
The time has come, the gods have turned
The lessons taught, the wisdom earned
For all the pain, for all the loss
We count the cost, we pay the cost

[Odysseus:]
A thousand ships, a world at stake
We fight for peace, for home’s own sake

[All:]
Troy, oh Troy, the legend’s born
A kingdom proud, a people sworn
For every tear, for every scar
The end is near, we’ve come this far

[Bridge:]
Raise up the flames, bring down the sky
A hero’s fate, a battle cry

[All:]
Troy, oh Troy, the legend’s born
A kingdom proud, a people sworn
For every tear, for every scar
The end is near, we’ve come this far
