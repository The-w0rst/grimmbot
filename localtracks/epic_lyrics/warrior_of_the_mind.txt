[Athena:]
I’ve always been the type to keep it all in
My armor made of steel, you can’t see through my skin
But the war is never ending, and my patience running thin
So if I can’t be the hero, then let me be the villain
I’m a warrior of the mind, I’m invincible
My walls are unbreakable, my will is unshakable
I’ll solve every riddle, I’ll fight every fight
I’ll win every battle, I’ll burn through the night
You can try to bring me down, but I will not kneel
With every wound I suffer, my resolve becomes real
I’m the storm that you can’t weather, I’m the shield you can’t break
I’m the war that lasts forever, I’m the risk you shouldn’t take
I’m a warrior of the mind, I’m invincible
My walls are unbreakable, my will is unshakable
I’ll solve every riddle, I’ll fight every fight
I’ll win every battle, I’ll burn through the night
[Bridge:]
If I fall, I will rise, every time stronger than before
There’s a fire in my eyes, and I won’t lose this war
I’m a warrior of the mind, I’m invincible
My walls are unbreakable, my will is unshakable
I’ll solve every riddle, I’ll fight every fight
I’ll win every battle, I’ll burn through the night
