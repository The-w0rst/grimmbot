Warrior of the Mind (Reprise)

[Athena:]
You thought I’d break, you thought I’d fall
But stronger still, I stand through all
The wisdom learned, the pain endured
The future now is reassured

I am a warrior of the mind
Resilient, fierce, one of a kind
Through every trial, every night
I rise again, I choose the fight

My walls unbreakable, my will unshakable
No riddle unsolved, no battle forsaken

[All:]
We are warriors of the mind
Unstoppable and undefined
We’ll fight, we’ll win, we will not yield
With mind and heart, we take the field
